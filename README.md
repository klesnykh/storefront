This application is meant to eventually take in an api of products that have categories and print the products from that api as well as the categories onto the screen.

If a user presses one category, all the products from that individual category will be shown

If a user presses to add to cart, that product will get added to his cart and get taken out of stock unless that user presses remove from cart, where it will get added back into stock
